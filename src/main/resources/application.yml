  # PlaidTransaction.merchantName will always be used, if available, as the name of a transaction's

  # Firefly uses a timestamp for when transactions occurred, but Plaid does not always provide a timestamp
  #   for transactions; often it only provides a date. In those cases, we need a time zone to apply so that
  #   the timestamp that shows up in Firefly properly spans the specified date in the user's timezone.
  # Acceptable values are any time zone name from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

  # Customize your Firefly transaction description string. When descriptionExpression is omitted or set to an empty
  # string, the description will be formatted as something like "merchantName: originalDescription".
  # The expressions are formed as Spring Expression Language (SpEL).
  # https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.x/reference/expressions.html
  # You should be able to access any of the fields seen under the "added" section of the Plaid sync transactions docs.
  # Note that the Plaid field names must be converted from snake_case to camelCase.
  # https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-added
  # Additionally, we set a few special variables that are prefixed with a "#". Those variables are:
  #  * #merchantAndDescription : The default description value that we use if you don't set any expression at all.
  #  * #merchantNameWithFallback : This will be set to the Plaid "merchant" field, if available, otherwise it will be
  #      set to the legacy "name" field.
  # Although we do our best to fall back to the default description format if you specify an invalid expression, this
  # can be a little difficult to use if you're unfamiliar with the format. Here are a few examples to get you started.
  #   * "transaction.name + ': ' + transaction.originalDescription" - This is a simple demonstration of how to access
  #       fields from the Plaid transaction and link them together. Notice how Plaid fields are NOT prefixed with "#",
  #       and you must use + and single quotes to concatenate those values with string literals.
  #   * "transaction.merchantName + ': ' + transaction.originalDescription" - This is an example of what NOT to do. If
  #       you look at the Plaid documentation you'll see that merchant_name is nullable. When we get a transaction where
  #       the merchant_name is not set, you'll get a description like "null: Your Original Description". If you don't
  #       want "null" showing up like that you'll need to look at the next few examples for tips on avoiding it.
  #   * "transaction.merchantName?:transaction.name + ': ' + transaction.originalDescription" - This demonstrates use of
  #       the Elvis operator to fallback to another value if the first is null. Note that "#merchantNameWithFallback" is
  #       the same as "merchantName?:name".
  #   * "transaction.originalDescription ?: transaction.merchantName ?: transaction.name" - This demonstrates chaining
  #       multiple Elvis operators together. This is a recommended expression if you want to have expressive
  #       descriptions with minimal redundancy.
  #   * "#merchantAndDescription + (transaction.amount > 100 ? ' (expensive!)' : '')" - This will append the string
  #       "(expensive!)" at the end of the description for transactions above a certain amount. This demonstrates usage
  #       of the SpEL ternary operator.
  # As some of the expression syntax can conflict with YAML syntax, it's important to explicitly quote this value.
  # If you're ok with new behavior, the expression below is the new recommended configuration.
  # descriptionExpression: "transaction.originalDescription ?: transaction.merchantName ?: transaction.name"
  # The expression below is the default to maintain the previous behavior.
#  descriptionExpression: "#merchantAndDescription"
  # Transaction categorization configuration (optional, defaults to disable categorization)
  # Plaid currently supplies two types of categorization information https://plaid.com/blog/transactions-categorization-taxonomy/
  # The current plan is to ignore the old categorization type because the new type (transaction.personalFinanceCategory)
  #   is fully rolled out and seems superior across the board.
  # If categorization is enabled, the category strings provided by Plaid for a given transaction
  #   will be added as tags to the Firefly transaction using the prefixes below.
  # This is intended to allow you to use Firefly's rule engine to use the tags as triggers to add the transaction to
  #   a budget or category or whatever, rather than trying to squeeze all that logic in here.
  # See https://plaid.com/documents/transactions-personal-finance-category-taxonomy.csv for a list of categories
  categorization:
    # Controls tagging for a Plaid transaction's primary personal finance category
    # If enabled, the prefix below will be used to create a tag with the transaction's primary personal finance category.
    # For instance, consider a transaction with primary category INCOME.
    #   With the default prefix, that transaction would be tagged in Firefly with "plaid-primary-cat-income"
    # Optional, defaults to disabled
    primary:
      # Set to true to enable tags for a Plaid transaction's primary personal finance category
      # Optional, defaults to false
      enable: true
      # Optional, defaults to "plaid-primary-cat-"
      prefix: "plaid-primary-cat-"
    # Controls tagging for a Plaid transaction's detailed personal finance category
    # Same as primary above, but using the detailed personal finance category field.
    # For instance, consider a transaction with detailed category INCOME_DIVIDENDS.
    #   With the default prefix, that transaction would be tagged in Firefly with "plaid-detailed-cat-dividends"
    # Optional, defaults to disabled
    detailed:
      # Set to true to enable tags for a Plaid transaction's detailed personal finance category
      # Optional, defaults to false
      enable: true
      prefix: "plaid-detailed-cat-"
