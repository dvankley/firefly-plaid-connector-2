/**
 * A representation of a transaction
 *
 * @param pendingTransactionId The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable.
 * @param categoryId The ID of the category to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
 * @param category A hierarchical array of the categories to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
 * @param location
 * @param paymentMeta
 * @param accountOwner The name of the account owner. This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts.
 * @param name The merchant name or transaction description.  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
 * @param accountId The ID of the account in which this transaction occurred.
 * @param amount The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative.
 * @param isoCurrencyCode The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
 * @param unofficialCurrencyCode The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
 * @param date For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ).
 * @param pending When `true`, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled.
 * @param transactionId The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.
 * @param paymentChannel The channel used to make a payment. `online:` transactions that took place online.  `in store:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `other:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  This field replaces the `transaction_type` field.
 * @param authorizedDate The date that the transaction was authorized. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ). The `authorized_date` field uses machine learning to determine a transaction date for transactions where the `date_transacted` is not available. If the `date_transacted` field is present and not `null`, the `authorized_date` field will have the same value as the `date_transacted` field.
 * @param authorizedDatetime Date and time when a transaction was authorized in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ).  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00).
 * @param datetime Date and time when a transaction was posted in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ).  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00).
 * @param transactionCode
 * @param transactionType Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types.
 * @param originalDescription The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/get`, this field is in beta and will be omitted unless the client is both enrolled in the closed beta program and has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.
 * @param merchantName The merchant name, as extracted by Plaid from the `name` field.
 * @param checkNumber The check number of the transaction. This field is only populated for check transactions.
 * @param personalFinanceCategory
