/**
 * The schedule that the payment will be executed on. If a schedule is provided, the payment is automatically set up as a standing order. If no schedule is specified, the payment will be executed only once.
 *
 * @param interval
 * @param intervalExecutionDay The day of the interval on which to schedule the payment.  If the payment interval is weekly, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).  If the payment interval is monthly, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer indicating which day of the month to make the payment on. Integers from 1 to 28 can be used to make a payment on that day of the month. Negative integers from -1 to -5 can be used to make a payment relative to the end of the month. To make a payment on the last day of the month, use -1; to make the payment on the second-to-last day, use -2, and so on.
 * @param startDate A date in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). Standing order payments will begin on the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the `start_date`.  If the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the start date is also the same day that `/payment_initiation/payment/create` was called, the bank *may* make the first payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so.
 * @param endDate A date in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). Standing order payments will end on the last `interval_execution_day` on or before the `end_date`. If the only `interval_execution_day` between the start date and the end date (inclusive) is also the same day that `/payment_initiation/payment/create` was called, the bank *may* make a payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so.
 * @param adjustedStartDate The start date sent to the bank after adjusting for holidays or weekends.  Will be provided in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). If the start date did not require adjustment, this field will be `null`.
